## Overview
State Farm is a large group of insurance companies throughout the United States with corporate headquarters in Bloomington, Illinois.
Their initiative is to improve these disturbing
statistics, and better ensure their customers, by
examining whether dashboard cameras can automatically detect drivers participating in distracting practices. Provided a dataset of dashboard camera pictures, State Farm is challenging Kagglers to classify each driver’s behavior, for example, what drivers are doing, and
whether they are distracted.

The dataset used in this project was provided
by State Farm through a Kaggle competition. The dataset contains a total of 102150 images
split into a training set of 22424 images and
a testing set of 79726 images (640 × 480 full
color).
There are 10 classes including safe driving in the dataset:

* c0 Safe driving.
* c1 Texting (right hand).
* c2 Talking on the phone (right hand).
* c3 Texting (left hand).
* c4 Talking on the phone (left hand).
* c5 Operating the radio.
* c6 Drinking.
* c7 Reaching behind.
* c8 Hair and makeup.
* c9 Talking to passenger(s).

This dataset is available on Kaggle, under the State Farm competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection
